<h2>Project Summary:</h2>
This project highlights the role of NSGs in Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines and how I used a protocol analyzer application (Wireshark), to inspect the flow of network traffic between virtual machines/networks. 

<h2>Environments, Applications and Technologies Used:</h2>

- Microsoft Azure cloud environment
- Azure virtual machines (Windows and Linux)
- Remote Desktop Connection application
- Wireshark protocol and traffic analyser
- Microsoft PowerShell

<h2>What are NSGs?</h2>
NSGs or Network Security Groups are essentially firewalls within virtual networks. They are mechanisms for access control within a virtual network and between a virtual network and other external network resources such as the Internet or other virtual networks. They aid granular level segmentation by defining perimeters.
